# Contributing

This project is intended as a sandbox to help you learn GitHub and about contributing to Open Source. Most changes are welcome!

If you do not see a feature or bug you would like to work on in the Issues, consider [submitting an Issue](https://github.com/runewake2/CubeFlyer/issues/new/choose) so we can track the work!

## First Contributions

For your first contribution to this project we recommend adding a [Greeting in the Greetings list](https://github.com/runewake2/CubeFlyer/issues/25).

You can do this by forking this repository onto your account, making the changes you would like, testing and committing them to your repository and then submitting a pull request against this repository to get your change merged into this code.

A sample first change might look like this:

```diff
const greetings = [
    '100% more Cube!',
+   'Hello, Open Source!'
];
```

Once you've made your change you can submit a pull request back to this project. This should create a testable version of the project so that others can review your change. In order to be merged into the project your change will need to be approved by one of the [Code Owners](https://github.com/runewake2/CubeFlyer/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) - these are contributors that own specific parts of the project. Once your change is approved it can be merged into the project and will be included in part of the playable game at flying-cube-game.netlify.app shortly afterwards!

## What's Next?

There are a few other things that would make this game really cool! They're filed as [issues that you can pick up and work on](https://github.com/runewake2/CubeFlyer/issues)! You are also welcome to [submit a new issue](https://github.com/runewake2/CubeFlyer/issues/new/choose) if you think a new feature that isn't listed would be neat or an undocumented bug is found.

Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on you can start discussing it in the Issue's comments and begin working on the change!
